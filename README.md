# Patient Health Monitoring System

In the context of a health monitoring system using MongoDB, this project focuses on a Patient’s wearable health monitor. This system is designed to monitor and manage patients with chronic conditions or those in need of continuous health tracking.

## Scenario Overview

The scenario involves patients with cardiovascular issues using wearable devices to transmit real-time health data powered by MongoDB. Healthcare providers can remotely monitor patients' health, access historical medical records, and intervene if necessary. The MongoDB database supports the storage and retrieval of patient information, medical records, and sensor data efficiently.

## Proposed Collections

1. **patients**: Stores information about the patient.
2. **medical_records**: Stores information about the patient’s medical conditions.
3. **sensor_data**: Collects information from the devices (specific parameters of the patient’s cardiovascular conditions).
